## Collaborative Filtering
A [basic paper](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Collaborative%20Filtering/summary/A%20Survey%20of%20Collaborative%20Filtering%20Algorithms%20for%20Social%20Recommender%20Systems.md) about collaborative filtering

The paper that first puts forward the [item-based collaborative filtering](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Collaborative%20Filtering/summary/Item-to-Item%20Collaborative%20Filtering.md)

This paper combines the cf with [implicit feedback](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Collaborative%20Filtering/summary/Collaborative%20Filtering%20for%20Implicit%20Feedback%20Datasets.md)

[A tool for cluster](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Collaborative%20Filtering/summary/Top-N%20Recommender%20System%20via%20Matrix%20Completion.md) in CF

## Matrix Factorization
[Probabilistic Matrix Factorization](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Matrix%20Factorization/summary/Probabilistic%20Matrix%20Factorization.md)

[Social Recommendation Using Probabilistic Matrix Factorization](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Matrix%20Factorization/summary/SoRec%20Social%20Recommendation%20Using%20PMF.md)



## Collaborative Ranking
Combine the [collaborative ranking with social relationships](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Collaborative%20Ranking/summary/Collaborative%20Ranking%20with%20Social%20Relationships%20for%20Top-N%20Recommendations.md)

## Top-N Problem
Combine pairwise ranking loss and pointwise recovery loss for [top-n problem](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Top%20N%20Problem/summary/Improving%20Top-N%20Recommendation%20with%20Heterogeneous%20Loss.md)

Use user graphs and item [graphs for top-n recommendation](https://github.com/chenboability/RecommenderSystem-Paper/blob/master/Top%20N%20Problem/summary/Top-N%20rcommendation%20on%20graphs.md)
